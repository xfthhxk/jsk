Agent protocol
--------------

agent starts connects to coordinator with identity

agent subscribes to agent messages topic.

coordinator keeps track of jobs to agents, publishes with that identity when picking an agent using a round Robin pattern for picking among agents.

agent filters on its identity. picks up a job request msg and acts accordingly.
job-start, job-abort
using push socket, tells coordinator it has started/aborted job.
when job finished send msg to coordinator with id, status, etc.

the coordinator does a ping request to all agents, a broadcast msg. agents respond. no response after 3 pings, remove agent from available set. send email alert to humans.

or

should agents check in periodically on their own with their status of jobs etc. how does agent know coordinator is alive? agent should send email to human if no contact with server in last N secs?

how does the web server know about what's happening? agents should publish to a topic?

web server can talk to coordinator to run adhoc jobs. schedule, job and schedule association changes need to be communicated to coordinator so it can reload it's data, update quartz runtime.

on coordinator start, publish msg to agents to register themselves.
then do broadcast pings every few secs


Top Priority
-------------
* kill is-visible-in-dashboard, just put everything that's got a
  schedule associated.
* email alerts, tie to job, send on failure/success
* freeze workflow on failure by default â€” for top level workflows only 
* Top level workflow dashboard.
  Shows top level workflows, last execution time, last execution
  status.  Updates from server need to check if the execution id's
  root wf is the top level workflow and update accordingly.
  



## TODO
* Variables
* Timeout feature
* Handle Vertex with 2 or more inbound edges. For simplicity, assume all have to have executed successfully
  What about a workflow with 3 starting nodes that must finish before going on?
  ie job 1, 2, 3 can be run in parallel, when all 3 finish do job 4.
  SystemNode? It's like a Countdown lock.
* Looping
* File/Directory monitor jobs
* Number of retries when a job fails
* Allow multiple instances of a job to run concurrently or not.
* We're snapshotting the dependencies but not the actual job definition.
* Search for jobs/wfs by schedule
* Replace enfocus with om
* View logs in UI


## Bugs
* Resuming a workflow/job doesn't set execution status to executing in DB.
* Delete workflow needs to auto delete the edges and vertices and then delete the workflow
